The list is a property list with the following properties:

`name'
  Name of service.

`command'
  Command to run.  This can be either a string or a lambda that return
  a string.

`args'
  Arguments passed to command.  This can be either a list of strings or
  a lambda that return a list of strings.

`cwd'
  Run command with this as `default-directory'.

`port'
  Specify service port for use with open function.

`tags'
  List of tags.

`init'
  Function called before process is started.

`init-async'
  Function called before process is started with async callback.

`stop-signal'
  How to signal processes when stopping it.  This property can have
  any of the following values:
   * `int' - Will use the function `interrupt-process'.
   * `kill' - Will use the function `kill-process'.
   * `quit' - Will use the function `quit-process'.
   * `stop' - Will use the function `stop-process'.
   * If neither of the above, the function `signal-process' will be
     called with that value.

`path'
  Use this to add directories to PATH when starting service process.
  This can be a string, a list or a function.  For more information
  see doc-string for `prodigy-service-path'.

`env'
  List of lists (with two items).  First item is the name of an
  environment variable and second item is the value of the variable.

`url'
  Single url or list of urls to use for browsing.  If single url is
  specified, use that.  If a list of urls are specified, ask for what
  url to browse.

`kill-process-buffer-on-stop'
  Kill associated process buffer when process stops.

`truncate-output'
 Truncates the process ouptut buffer.  If set to t, truncates to
 `prodigy-view-buffer-maximum-size' lines.  If set to an integer,
 truncates to that number of lines.

`on-output'
  Call this function with (service, output), each time process gets
  new output.

`ready-message'
  The text that a service displays when it is ready.  Will be
  matched as a regexp.")
