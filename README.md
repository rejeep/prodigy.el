# Prodigy [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/rejeep/prodigy.el.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/rejeep/prodigy.el)

Manage external services from within Emacs

I came up with the idea when I got to work one Monday morning and
before I could start working I had to manually start ten or so
services.

To get rid of this tedious work, I started working on this Emacs
plugin. Prodigy provides a
[Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit)-like GUI to manage services in
a simple way.

## Installation

Add `prodigy` to your [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) file:

```lisp
(depends-on "prodigy")
```

## Usage

Services can be defined in a few different ways. See doc-string for
information about available properties to specify: `M-x
describe-variable RET prodigy-services`.

### prodigy-define-service (`&rest args`)

Services can be defined using the function `prodigy-define-service`:

```lisp
(prodigy-define-service :prop value ...)
```

### prodigy-services

Services can be defined by setting the variable `prodigy-services`:

```lisp
(setq prodigy-services
 '((:prop value ...)
   (:prop value ...)))
```

### customize

TODO

## Filters

Filters is a way to show only specific services in the Prodigy
buffer. For example services with specific tag or with a name matching
a string.

To add a filter, use `prodigy-add-filter`:

```lisp
(prodigy-add-filter :tag 'foo)
(prodigy-add-filter :name "bar")
```

You can also set the variable `prodigy-filters` directly:

```lisp
(setq prodigy-filters
      '((:tag foo)
        (:name "bar")))
```
