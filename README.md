# Prodigy

Manage external services from within Emacs

I came up with the idea when I got to work one Monday morning and
before I could start working I had to manually start ten or so
services.

To get rid of this tedious work, I started working on this Emacs
plugin, which provides a nice and simple GUI to manage services.

## Installation

Add `prodigy` to your [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) file:

```lisp
(depends-on "prodigy")
```

## Usage

Start Prodigy with `M-x prodigy`. You should see a list of all defined
services.

### Services

Services can be defined in a few different ways. See doc-string for
information about available properties to specify: `M-x
describe-variable RET prodigy-services`.

#### prodigy-define-service (`&rest args`)

Services can be defined using the function `prodigy-define-service`:

```lisp
(prodigy-define-service :prop value ...)
```

#### prodigy-services

Services can be defined by setting the variable `prodigy-services`:

```lisp
(setq prodigy-services
 '((:prop value ...)
   (:prop value ...)))
```

### Tags

Services can have any number of tags. Tags does not have to be pre
defined. If they are, the service will inherit all the tags
properties. Tags can also have tags. A service will inherit all tags
recursively.

See doc-string for information about available properties to specify:
`M-x describe-variable RET prodigy-tags`.

#### prodigy-define-tag (`&rest args`)

Tags can be defined using the function `prodigy-define-tag`:

```lisp
(prodigy-define-tag :prop value ...)
```

#### prodigy-tags

Tags can be defined by setting the variable `prodigy-tags`:

```lisp
(setq prodigy-tags
 '((:prop value ...)
   (:prop value ...)))
```

### Filters

Filters is a way to show only specific services in the Prodigy
buffer. For example services with specific tag or with a name matching
a string.

#### prodigy-add-filter (`&rest args`)

To add a filter, use `prodigy-add-filter`:

```lisp
(prodigy-add-filter :tag 'foo)
(prodigy-add-filter :name "bar")
```

#### prodigy-filters

You can also set the variable `prodigy-filters` directly:

```lisp
(setq prodigy-filters
      '((:tag foo)
        (:name "bar")))
```

### Status

Each service is associated with a status. The built in statuses are:

* `stopped` (default) - The process is not running.
* `running` - The process is running. If the process status is `run`,
  this status will be used.
* `ready` - The process is "actually" ready. This will be set when the
  service outputs a message that matches its `ready-message` property,
  or it can be set manually.
* `stopping` - Set when a service is stopping.
* `failed` - The process failed. A service has this status if:
  * It is not started within `prodigy-start-tryouts` seconds.
  * Or, it is not stopped within `prodigy-stop-tryouts` seconds.
  * Or, if the process exit code is non zero.

The only way Prodigy has an idea of the service status, is to look at
the process status (note the difference between service and process
status). The process status is however not always a very good
indication of the service "actual" status. For example, it takes about
five seconds to start a Rails server, but the process status will be
`run` almost instantly after started.

To improve the service status, there is a function called
`prodigy-set-status`, that can change the status of a service. The
function takes two arguments: The `service` and the `status-id`. The
status id has to be one of the statuses in `prodigy-status-list`.

You can create your own status with the function
`prodigy-define-status`. See doc-string for information about
available properties to specify: `M-x describe-variable RET
prodigy-status-list`.

For more information, see status example below!

## Examples

### Python Simple HTTP Server

This service start a Python Simple HTTP Server on port `6001`. When
stopping the service, the `sigkill` signal is used.

```lisp
(prodigy-define-service
  :name "Python app"
  :command "python"
  :args '("-m" "SimpleHTTPServer" "6001")
  :cwd "/path/to/my/project"
  :tags '(work)
  :kill-signal 'sigkill
  :kill-process-buffer-on-stop t)
```

### Nodemon Server

This service starts a Nodemon serveron port `6002`. The project is
using NVM (Node Version Manager), so before the process starts, NVM is
set up.

```lisp
(prodigy-define-service
  :name "Node app"
  :command "nodemon"
  :cwd "/path/to/my/project"
  :args '("app.coffee")
  :port 6002
  :tags '(work node)
  :init-async (lambda (done)
                (nvm-use-for "/path/to/my/project" done)))
```

### Sinatra Server

This service starts a Sinatra server on port `6003`. The project is
using RVM (Ruby Version Manager), so before the process starts, RVM is
set up.

```lisp
(prodigy-define-service
  :name "Sinatra"
  :command "server"
  :cwd "/path/to/my/project"
  :path '("/path/to/my/project/bin")
  :port 6003
  :tags '(work ruby)
  :init-async (lambda (done)
                (rvm-activate-ruby-for "/path/to/my/project" done)))
```

### Tag inheritance

If a service has a tag and that tag is defined (see
`prodigy-define-tag`), the service inherits the tag properties. The
inheritance is recursive, so if any of the service tags has tags
itself, the service will inherit those tag properties as well.

This is best illustrated with an example. Rails can run with many
different servers. Each server indicate that it's ready with a
different log message. In the example code below, a tag is defined for
each server and one for Rails that inherits all those servers.

That means that a service that is tagged with `rails`, will be set to
ready if it uses any of the three servers. But since there is a tag
for each server, a non Rails service that uses any of the servers can
simply use that tag.

```lisp
(prodigy-define-tag
  :name 'thin
  :ready-message "Listening on 0\\.0\\.0\\.0:[0-9]+, CTRL\\+C to stop")

(prodigy-define-tag
  :name 'webrick
  :ready-message "WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=[0-9]+ port=[0-9]+")

(prodigy-define-tag
  :name 'mongrel
  :ready-message "Ctrl-C to shutdown server")

(prodigy-define-tag
  :name 'rails
  :tags '(thin mongrel webrick))

(prodigy-define-service
  :name "Rails Project"
  :command "bundle"
  :args '("exec" "rails" "server")
  :cwd "/path/to/my/project"
  :tags '(rails))

(prodigy-define-service
  :name "Thin Project"
  :command "bundle"
  :args '("exec" "thin" "start")
  :cwd "/path/to/my/project"
  :tags '(thin))
```

### Fine Tuning Status

Prodigy can only look at the *process* status to determine the
*service* status. To make status even more useful, you can set status
manually. Prodigy provides the function `prodigy-set-status` for
this. In this example, we create a tag `rails` that will set the
status to `ready` when the server is actually ready.

The services that are tagged with `rails` will all inherit this.

```lisp
(prodigy-define-tag
  :name 'rails
  :on-output (lambda (service output)
               (when (or (s-matches? "Listening on 0\.0\.0\.0:[0-9]+, CTRL\\+C to stop" output)
                         (s-matches? "Ctrl-C to shutdown server" output))
                 (prodigy-set-status service 'ready))))

(prodigy-define-service
  :name "Rails"
  :command "bundle"
  :args '("exec" "rails" "server")
  :cwd "/path/to/my/project"
  :tags '(rvm rails))

(prodigy-define-service
  :name "Sinatra"
  :command "bundle"
  :args '("exec" "rackup")
  :cwd "/path/to/my/project"
  :tags '(rvm rails))
```

## Troubleshoot

### Jekyll

For some unknown reason, Jekyll fail with this error:

```
error: invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII. Use --trace to view backtrace
```

This can be solved by adding a `jekyll` tag, like this:

```lisp
(prodigy-define-tag
  :name 'jekyll
  :env '(("LANG" "en_US.UTF-8")
         ("LC_ALL" "en_US.UTF-8")))
```

Then tag your services with the `jekyll` tag.
